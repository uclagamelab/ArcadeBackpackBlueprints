Arcade Backpack Blueprints

Full blueprint for the UCLA Game Lab Arcade Backpack. Features illustrated step-by-step instructions and a materials list. These blueprints will help guide your arcade backpack project – be sure to show us what you make!

A Brief Background on the Backpack:

The Arcade Backpack was created to infiltrate public space. Ironically, the backpack’s debut at the 2nd Annual UCLA Game Art Festival was so successful in infiltrating our own event that it stole the show and has become the most popular above ground game lab project.

The cabinet frame is constructed of lasercut plywood and assembled to house a laptop, arcade style controls, and an LED Marquee powered by a drill battery. The entire cabinet is holstered onto a military grade back frame and can be adjusted to fit comfortably on any unsuspecting Game Lab resident.

Good luck & enjoy!
